		<p>As you may see on top of the webpage my name is Russ Christensen and I currently live in Murray Utah. I currently work as an Underwriter for an insurance company, but currently towards a career in web development!</p>
		
		<p>As much as I love coding, it was never my first love. I studied Mathematics down in Cedar City, Utah at Southern Utah University and then pursued a Masters in Mathematics at Wichita State University in Kansas. My real love was always in statistics. My hope is that I can implement was I learned in graduate school into my development skills.</p>

		<p>In October of 2017, I married my beautiful wife Cheri (whom you see in the picture) and she is the fuel and energy that makes me do what I do today. I truly am blessed!</p>

		<p> Feel free to check out my website and give me some feedback on my submit page! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
